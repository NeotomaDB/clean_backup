# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Neotoma's development. It's people like you that make Neotoma such a great community.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for the developers.  If you wish to make any of these contributions please read on.

## Submitting changes

Send GitHub Pull Requests to [NeotomaDB/clean_backup](https://github.com/NeotomaDB/clean_backup), adding a clear list of the contributions of the pull request. In particular we'd appreciate test coverage where possible, and more documentation.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Please try to use some form of linting, or code style with your contributions. This includes proper indentation (generally, 2 spaces), proper spacing around commas and operators, no trailing whitespace and clear variable naming conventions.

## Asking for Help

Please feel free to contact us through this repositories Issues, by contacting us directly, or through our Slack channel, to ask any questions.
